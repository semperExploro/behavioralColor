## Description
Behavioral Color (Mindhive) is a program designed to illustrate the affects of the influence of color on user choices. 

The program comprises of four rounds in order to demonstrate affects of color influence on decisions. There are four categories that are found in "words.txt", with each category having their respective word and color type. For instance, all words associated with ocean are colored blue. In each round, there are a total of 20 words, with 5 words randomly selected from each category.

## Execuction

**Round 1:** All words are of the same color. <br />
**Round 2:** All words are of random color. <br />
**Round 3:** All words in a given category are assigned the wrong color. 5 words from each category (4) chosen at random are then given to the user. <br />
**Round 4:** Words are displayed with the correct color. <br />

In all rounds, the words are displayed in random order. 

## Running Program

You can try the program at: https://replit.com/@semperExploro/MindHive?v=1
Or you can try on your computer by doing "make", and the executable "mindHive" should appear. This only works on linux and MacOS. Please note that the make file is not configured to run on a generic MAC/Linux computer but is for a Windows Machine. Install appropriate libraries. To run on windows, configure your computer so you can compile a c++ file via make. 

#### Notes

- This program is still in BETA. Bugs may be apparent. 
- The program is also not random on each run. Meaning, everytime you run the program the words will be the same. The intent of this program is a demonstrator, not so much as a skills test, thus is only meant to be ran once. 
- Code style: Because this program was requested to be completed in 2 days, the code is not opitimized.
